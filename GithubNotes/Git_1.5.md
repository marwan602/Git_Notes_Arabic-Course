Git branch: Checks what branch you're on (main, branch, etc.)
git remote -v: Gets remote name
git push (remoteName) (branch name): Pushes changes in local repo (current branch) to the remote repo
Practice:
Pushed all git notes onto github (In addition reverted unwanted changes through git reset --hard (commit_id) due to messing up and inserting unwanted files )
